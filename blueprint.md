    *   **Expand Categories:** Added "Técnica", "Jugadas a Balón Parado", and "Preparación Física".
    *   **Enrich Content:** Added a variety of high-quality drills to the library.
    *   **UI with Smart Filters:** Implemented a user interface with filters for category and difficulty, allowing coaches to easily find the drills they need.

*   **Phase 2: Supercharge the Tactical Board (Completed)**
    *   **Draggable Ball:** Added a ball that can be dragged and dropped on the pitch.
    *   **Save/Load Formations:** Allowed coaches to save their favorite formations and load them later.
    *   **Drawing Mode:** Implemented a drawing mode that allows coaches to illustrate plays and strategies directly on the board.

*   **Phase 3: Advanced Management & Analytics**
    *   **Enhanced Player Profiles (Completed):** Redesigned the player profile screen to be more comprehensive and visually engaging. This includes a modern UI with a holographic feel, detailed stats, and an improved radar chart for player skills.
